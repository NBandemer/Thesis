Classification vs Regression (Classification)

We are classifying a match as a win or loss for player 1 based on the provided statistics.
We also could make a regression model which calculates an overall score for each player, and then convert to a classification using buckets
The model will be trained to predict what will happen in a specific match, based on the previous matches of both players



List of models 

Comparing the models (accuracy, precision, f1-scores, etc)

Determine if the dataset is viable and add more data
